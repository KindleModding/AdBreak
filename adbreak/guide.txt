Requirements:
  - Ad-supported Kindle (can't be blacklisted)
  - Firmware version from 5.18.1 to 5.18.5
  - Computer + cable (lol)

1. Check the Amazon firmware updates page for your device. If a version newer than 5.18.5 is out, this has likely been patched.
   You may also just want to avoid updating in case this doesn't work for some reason. See the following guide on how to prevent automatically updating:
     https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/prevent-auto-update.html

2. If not done already, connect to the Internet and log into an Amazon account on the Kindle to register it.

3. Leave it connected to the Internet for a while so it can download advertisements. If you press the lock button, an advertisement should be displayed. 
   If advertisements aren't being downloaded after a while, a factory reset may help.

4. Once you've verified ads are being displayed on the lockscreen, swipe down and turn on Airplane mode.

5. Click on the top right menu and select "View all ads", which should display multiple "special offers".

6. Plug in the Kindle, open the system folder and and copy ".assets" to your desktop.

7. Download and extract "adbreak.zip", copy the contents to the ".assets" folder on your desktop.

8. Replace the contents of all "details.html" files with the contents of "adbreak.html":
  Windows: Double click on "replace.bat"
  Linux/Mac CLI: find . -name 'details.html' -exec cp adbreak.html {} \;

9. Delete the original .assets folder on the Kindle and replace it with our modified copy.

10. Click on an ad and go through the popups, once you click OK on "Bang!", the jailbreak should run.

11. Congrats, install the hotfix and enjoy your liberated device - https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/post-jailbreak/setting-up-a-hotfix/
